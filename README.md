PROJECT:

*A Unity game based on an "arcade game, platform game and endless run":*
### Dodge the blocks and kill enemies.

This is a first person game (FPP). 
The map is divided in three parts\sections and the player moves continuously. 
The character can moves left and right using "A/D" keys ad left and right,  and based on the direction of the human eye they can see around and aim at the enemies , so if the gamer looks right the player visual moves right and viceversa.
This is allowed to us by the *_Tobii sensor_*. It's an eye tracker , so with it's help we can let know to the game where the human wants to see by simply getting the coordinates by capturing the light that comes out of the sensor and then bounce back on the iris of the gamer. 
To let the gamer shoot we are using the *_Emotiv headset_*(a helmet controlled by EEG impulses). This will read the brain impulses and convert them in electrical signals that we can assign to a specific keyboard key. 

For the 3D models in the game we used Blender(an oper source software) to sculpt characters and object for the game. 
And in the end to assemble all the things we used Unity(a cross-platform graphics engine) and code the in C#. 
We got a little help in the codes by the Tobii Eyetracking Unity SDK Documentation (https://tobii.github.io/UnitySDK/manual#import-the-assets)
