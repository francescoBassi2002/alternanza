PROJECT:

*A Unity game based on three levels:*

1)dodge the blocks 
2)kill the final boss

This is a first person game. The player is on a stage and he could move only left to right. You have eto fight againts sime blocks and after a run, reach a door and go to kill the boss. 

You will use Emotiv (a helmet controlled by EEG impulses) to shoot the blocks, "a"/"d" keyboards to move the player left to right and Tobii(an eyetracking system) to look around and aim the blocks. 

We used Unity and Blender to design 3D models. We started from scratch to make everything...from the floor to the torches and the weapon.
