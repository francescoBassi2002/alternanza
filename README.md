PROJECT:

*A Unity game based on an arcade game:*

1)dodge the blocks and enemies 
2)kill the final boss

This is a first person game (FPP). 
The map is divided in three parts\sections and the player moves continuously. He only stops to shoot the enemies. 
The character moves left and right based on the direction of the human eyes, so if the gamer looks right the player moves right and viceversa. 
For this to happen we used the Tobii sensor. It's an eye tracker , so with the help of the sensor we can let know to the game where the human want's to move by simply getting the coordinates of the light that comes out of the sensor and then bounce back on the eye iris. 
To let the gamer shoot we will you the Emotiv headset(a helmet controlled by EEG impulses). This will read the brain impulses and convert them in electrical signals. 


You will use Emotiv (a helmet controlled by EEG impulses) to shoot the blocks, "a"/"d" keyboards to move the player left to right and Tobii(an eyetracking system) to look around and aim the blocks. 

We used Unity and Blender to design 3D models. We started from scratch to make everything...from the floor to the torches and the weapon.
